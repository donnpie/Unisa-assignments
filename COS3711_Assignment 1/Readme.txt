I apologise profusely for the lateness of this submission. 
My family has been plagued by serious illness, and generally life has been a disaster. 
I realise that is no excuse, but I hope that I can at least still get some marks or even just entrance into the exam.

Some challenges i faced while preparing this submission:
Q1: Could not get the dynamic casts to correctly convert derived class object pointed to by base class pointer.
Q4:Could not get the QRegExpValidators to work. I spent a very long time on this but ultimately had to give up.


Regards,
